    "# Advent of Code 2022\n",
    "### This Notebook contains my python solutions for AdventOfCode 2022 event in the form of a story.\n",
    "\n",
    "With Christmas just around the corner, I was approached by the elves. Just like every year, they came up with yet another issue that required my assistance. Namely, was high time to embark on an annual journey to the middle of the jungle in a search for magical **star fruits**. The fruits would then be used as snacks for the reindeers during delivery of the gifts! The jungle is located on a remote island and most of the fruits grow in a grove in the middle of it. \n",
    "\n",
    "They reassured me very firmly that my presence is required as I was chosen to be a Guest of Honour. I reluctantly agreed and well-aware of the clumsiness of the elves who in the years prior managed to (lose keys to the Santa sleigh)[https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/1], (destroy the Printer of the Naughty or Nice List)[https://adventofcode.com/2017/day/1] or even (losing Santa stranded in the cosmos)[https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/1], decided to grab all the fruit I can find on the way...\n",
    "\n",
    "And, just like expected, the elves succeeded in turning this journey into a chore..\n",
    "\n",
    "## Day 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Time to start the journey! _As our boats approach land, the Elves begin taking inventory of their supplies. One important consideration is food - in particular, the number of Calories each Elf is carrying._ The input for that day looks as follows:\n",
    "```\n",
    "1000\n",
    "2000\n",
    "3000\n",
    "\n",
    "4000\n",
    "\n",
    "5000\n",
    "6000\n",

    "8000\n",
    "9000\n",
    "\n",
    "10000\n",
    "```\n",
    "So, the first elf carries three bags, with `1000`, `2000` and `3000` calories respectively, next one carries one bag with `4000` calories and so on. My task was to figure out the following:\n",
    "- **part one:** one of the elves carries the most calories. How many does he carry?\n",
    "- **part two:** how many calories are carried by the three elves, who carry the most calories?"

    "I was woken up by a quarrel. Since everybody knew where the snack tent is to be erected, everybody wanted to set up his own tent as close as possible. To calm down the ruckus, and figure out who gets the best spot, a game of **Rock, Paper, Scissors** was initiated. As a \"thank you\" gift for my help yesterday, **Frostbiteface**, a veteran elf, gave me a cheat book telling me how to play against the elves in order to get the most points. The book listed the moves in the following way:\n",

    "A Y\n",
